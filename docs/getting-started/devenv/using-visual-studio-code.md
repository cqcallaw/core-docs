# Development using Visual Studio Code

## Installation
1. Download and install the .NET Core if you have not already done so.
2. [Download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/setup).

## Configuration

Read the [Additional Components](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/setup#_additional-components) and [Code Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/setup#_vs-code-extensions) sections of the Visual Studio Code setup documentation for information on configurating Visual Studio Code for your language of choice. At minimum, one will generally require a language extension and a debugging extension, though many languages extensions include debugging capabilities. For example, to develop C# programs, the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) is required.
